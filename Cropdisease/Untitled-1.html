On the lower side of leaves, rings of grayish white mycelium and spore-forming structures may appear around the blotches.</td><td>Spraying fungicides is the most effective way to prevent late blight. For conventional gardeners and commercial producers, protectant fungicides such as chlorothalonil (e.g., Bravo, Echo, Equus, or Daconil) and Mancozeb (Manzate) can be used</td><td>&lt;iframe width=&quot;999&quot; height=&quot;638&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;embed&#x2F;mHrcs1c_ToA&quot; title=&quot;Late Blight Disease Management in Tomato &amp; Potato Crops | BigHaat&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;&#x2F;iframe&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>Tomato_Early_blight</td><td>The main symptom of early blight is round leaf spots with a characteristic target appearance due to the dark concentric rings that develop in most spots. They are about .5 inch in diameter. Spots first appear on older leaves near the base of the plant. The causal fungal pathogen also produces symptoms on stems and fruit. Young seedlings can be killed by stem lesions developing at their base. Sources of the pathogen are infested seed, debris from infected plants left in or on the soil (where it can survive at least 1 year), and spores from other affected plants dispersed typically short distances by wind, water, insects, or animals.</td><td>When planting tomatoes, make a plan to prevent blight. Incorporate these simple steps to keep your plants healthy. Practice crop rotation by planting tomatoes in a section of the garden that has not been used to grow tomatoes or any other member of the Solanaceae family, such as eggplant, potatoes or peppers, in the last two years.Read seed packages or plant labels carefully to select a tomato variety that is resistant to blight. Stake or cage tomato plants so that foliage grows vertically, off the ground.Mulch well around plants. When watering, use a soaker hose rather than an overhead sprinkler. This will reduce the amount of water on leaves and keep spores in the soil from splashing on plants.</td><td>&lt;iframe width=&quot;967&quot; height=&quot;544&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;embed&#x2F;MNMg9EGRcJU&quot; title=&quot;5 SIMPLE Ways to Prevent Early Tomato Blight Organically&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;&#x2F;iframe&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>Tomato_Leaf_Mold</td><td>Cladosporium fulvum is an Ascomycete called Passalora fulva, a non-obligate pathogen that causes the disease on tomato known as the tomato leaf mold.[1] P. fulva only attacks tomato plants, especially the foliage, and it is a common disease in greenhouses, but can also occur in the field.[2] The pathogen is likely to grow in humid and cool conditions. In greenhouses, this disease causes big problems during the fall, in the early winter and spring, due to the high relative humidity of air and the temperature,[3] that are propitious for the leaf mold development. This disease was first described in the North Carolina, by Mordecai Cubitt Cooke (1883), on cultivated tomato (Cooke 1883), although it is originally from South and Central America. The causal fungus of tomato leaf mold may also be referred to as Cladosporium fulvum (Cooke 1883), a former name.</td><td>The pathogen P. fulfa can survive on infected plant debris or in the soil, although the initial source of the disease is often infected seed. The disease is spread by rain and wind, on tools and clothing, and via insect activity. High relative humidity (greater that 85%) combined with high temperatures encourages the spread of the disease. With that in mind, if growing tomatoes in a greenhouse, maintain night temps higher than outside temperatures. When planting, use only certified disease-free seed or treated seed. Remove and destroy all crop debris post-harvest. Sanitize the greenhouse between crop seasons. Use fans and avoid overhead watering to minimize leaf wetness. Also, stake and prune plants to increase ventilation.</td><td>&lt;iframe width=&quot;967&quot; height=&quot;544&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;embed&#x2F;0lZOboTH8m4&quot; title=&quot;⟹ Tomato leaf mold | Cladosporium fulvum | Not to be confused with early blight&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;&#x2F;iframe&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>Tomato_Spider_mites_Two_spotted_spider_mite</td><td>The tomato red spider mite can be found on both sides of leaves but it prefers the undersides near the leaf veins. Feeding causes leaves to become yellowish white and mottled. Tomato red spider mite produces webbing, especially on the undersides of leaves. In high infestations, dense webbing can mummify plants.</td><td>Prune leaves, stems and other infested parts of plants well past any webbing and discard in trash (and not in compost piles). Don’t be hesitant to pull entire plants to prevent the mites spreading to its neighbors.Use the Bug Blaster to wash plants with a strong stream of water and reduce pest numbers.Commercially available beneficial insects, such as ladybugs, lacewing and predatory mites are important natural enemies. For best results, make releases when pest levels are low to medium.</td><td>&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;embed&#x2F;iRYvw9vRguk&quot; title=&quot;Spider Mites - 4 Ways To Naturally Get Rid Of Them&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;&#x2F;iframe&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>Tomato_Tomato_mosaic_virus</td><td>The foliage of affected tomato plants shows mottling, with alternating yellowish and darker green areas, the latter often appearing thicker and raised giving a blister-like appearance. The leaves tend to be fern-like in appearance with pointed tips and younger leaves may be twisted.</td><td>To avoid seed-borne mosaic viruses, soak seeds of susceptible plants in a 10% bleach solution before planting., Remove all infected plants and destroy them. Do NOT put them in the compost pile, as the virus may persist in infected plant matter. Burn infected plants or throw them out with the garbage.,Monitor the rest of your plants closely, especially those that were located near infected plants. Disinfect gardening tools after every use. Keep a bottle of a weak bleach solution or other antiviral disinfectant to wipe your tools down with.</td><td>&lt;iframe width=&quot;631&quot; height=&quot;353&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;embed&#x2F;_w5GwfbVytE&quot; title=&quot;Tomato Mosaic Virus (Symptoms and Management) | Mosaic Virus | Krishi Network&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;&#x2F;iframe&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>TomatoTomato_YellowLeafCurl_Virus</td><td>Symptoms of TYLCV infection include severe stunting, reduction of leaf size, upward cupping&#x2F;curling of leaves, chlorosis on leaves and flowers, and reduction of fruit production. This virus can cause significant yield losses from 90–100%</td><td>Maintain good weed control in the field and surrounding areas. Prevent the spread of any whiteflies to healthy plants. Tomato and pepper fields should be cleaned up immediately after harvest. Also destroy crop residues of melons and cotton immediately after harvest to reduce whitefly migration.</td><td>&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;embed&#x2F;191dy9xes1E&quot; title=&quot;leaf curl virus treatment in vegetables | leaf curl in chilli &amp; tomato plant | leaf curl treatment&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;&#x2F;iframe&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>Tomato_Target_Spot</td><td>Target spot of tomato is caused by the fungal pathogen Corynespora cassiicola. 1 The disease occurs on field-grown tomatoes in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. </td><td>Pruning suckers and older leaves in the lower canopy can also increase airflow and reduce leaf wetness. Avoid planting tomatoes near old plantings. Inspect seedlings for target spot symptoms before transplanting. Manage weeds, which may serve as alternate hosts, and avoid the use of overhead irrigation.</td><td>&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;embed&#x2F;V3DKnjCxBvQ&quot; title=&quot;Tomato | How to control black spot in tomato || 70% control easily || ಟೊಮ್ಯಾಟೊ ಕಪ್ಪು ಚುಕ್ಕೆ ರೋಗ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;&#x2F;iframe&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>Tomato_Septoria_leaf_spot</td><td>Septoria leaf spot is caused by the fungus Septoria lycopersici. This fungus can attack tomatoes at any stage of development, but symptoms usually first appear on the older, lower leaves and stems when plants are setting fruit. Symptoms usually appear on leaves, but can occur on petioles, stems, and the calyx.</td><td>Septoria leaf spot is caused by the fungus Septoria lycopersici.
